    <div><h3>Introduction</h3><p>
    Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642 [January 4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England—died March 20 [March 31], 1727, London), English physicist and mathematician, who was the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Newton’s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single works in the history of modern science

   <div><h3>Education</h3>
    <p>Isaac Newton studied at the Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661. At 22 in 1665, a year after beginning his four-year scholarship, Newton finished his first significant discovery in mathematics, where he revealed the generalized binomial theorem. He was bestowed with his B.A. degree in the same year.

        Isaac Newton held numerous positions throughout his life. In 1671, he was invited to join the Royal Society of London after developing a new and enhanced version of the reflecting telescope.
        
        He was later elected President of the Royal Society (1703). Sir Isaac Newton ran for a seat in Parliament in 1689. He won the election and became a Member of Parliament for Cambridge University. He was also appointed as a Warden of the Mint in 1969. Due to his exemplary work and dedication to the mint, he was chosen Master of the Mint in 1700. After being knighted in 1705, he was known as “Sir Isaac Newton.”</p>

    <h3>Achievements in Brief</h3>
    <p>Isaac Newton, who was largely self-taught in mathematics and physics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generalized the binomial theorem</li>
        <li>Showed that sunlight is made up of all of the colors of the rainbow. He used one glass prism to split a beam of sunlight into its separate colors, then another prism to recombine the rainbow colors to make a beam of white light again.</li>
        <li>Built the world’s first working reflecting telescope.</li>
        <li>Discovered/invented calculus, the mathematics of change, without which we could not understand the behavior of objects as tiny as electrons or as large as galaxies.</li>
        <li>Wrote the Principia, one of the most important scientific books ever written; in it he used mathematics to explain gravity and motion. (Principia is pronounced with a hard c.)</li>
        <li>Discovered the law of universal gravitation, proving that the force holding the moon in orbit around the earth is the same force that causes an apple to fall from a tree.</li>
        <li>Formulated his three laws of motion – Newton’s Laws – which lie at the heart of the science of movement.</li>
        <li>formulated his three laws of motion – Newton’s Laws – which lie at the heart of the science of movement.</li>
        <li>Proved that all objects moving through space under the influence of gravity must follow a path shaped in the form of one of the conic sections, such as a circle, an ellipse, or a parabola, hence explaining the paths all planets and comets follow.</li>
        <li>Showed that the tides are caused by gravitational interactions between the earth, the moon, and the sun.</li>
        <li>Predicted, correctly, that the earth is not perfectly spherical but is squashed into an oblate spheroid, larger around the equator than around the poles.</li>
        <li>Used mathematics to model the movement of fluids – from which the concept of a Newtonian fluid comes.</li>
        <li>Devised Newton’s Method for finding the roots of mathematical functions.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <div><h3>Thoughts of Isaac Newton </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy</li>
            <li>"Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things."</li>
            <li>"Genius is patience."</li>
            <li>In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence.</li>
            <li>What goes up must come down.</li>
            <li>My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success.</li>
            <li>If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.</li>
        </ul>
